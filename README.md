# PepperTux Godot
This is the new version of PepperTux. It's a SuperTux fangame made using Godot 4.5.1 that's meant to be similar to old versions of SuperTux like 0.3.3 to 0.5.1.

## Story
The same story as SuperTux, basically, Tux goes to a picnic with Penny, but Nolok attacks the two penguins and captures Penny, leaving just a note telling Tux that he doesn't stand a chance at getting Penny back, so Tux goes forward towards Nolok's Icy Island castle, thinking Penny is there.

## Build Instructions
* Download Godot 4.5.1
* Download the export templates for Godot 4.5.1
* Build the game like you would with any other Godot game.
