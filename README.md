# PepperTux Godot
PepperTux, but in Godot!

This is the new version of PepperTux, and the old repository (peppertux-game) will soon be renamed to peppertux-old.

## Story
The same story as SuperTux, basically, Tux goes to a picnic with Penny, but Nolok attacks the two penguins and captures Penny, leaving just a note telling Tux that he doesn't stand a chance at getting Penny back, so Tux goes forward towards Nolok's Icy Island castle, thinking Penny is there.
